# Field Editors by PI

Select an artifact type (defect,userstory or one level of portfolio item), then a field, then a list of users who are allowed to change that field and Go.  

The app will examine the revision history and determine if someone not authorized made a change to that field.

## App Settings

#### Type of Timebox
Options are:
 - Date (custom start to end dates)
 - Release

 #### Caveats
 If a field name is changed, it is possible that the search will not find changes to it that 
 happened before the change.

#### Use Individual Item Picker
 Determines whether or not to allow for selection of a portfolio item or a record type.  The default is to select a record type.  

## Development Notes
Note that this scans revision history because lookback doesn't hold information about text fields.
The app first gathers the items that are appropriate then sends further calls to ask for rev
histories for each item that have the associated field in the description.  

This is an example of using parallel chunking -- splitting the query into smaller bits that can be run in parallel.  (When 2500 items are found and we query for all of their revision histories in a giant OR statement, we sometimes get "communications failure".)

To further help performance, if the start date is chosen, the app will only find items that have a
last update date greater than or equal to the start date.  Otherwise, it finds all items (or all
items in the same release) AND then applies the rev history logic.

### First Load

If you've just downloaded this from github and you want to do development,
you're going to need to have these installed:

 * node.js
 * grunt-cli
 * grunt-init

Since you're getting this from github, we assume you have the command line
version of git also installed.  If not, go get git.

If you have those three installed, just type this in the root directory here
to get set up to develop:

  npm install

### Structure

  * src/javascript:  All the JS files saved here will be compiled into the
  target html file
  * src/style: All of the stylesheets saved here will be compiled into the
  target html file
  * test/fast: Fast jasmine tests go here.  There should also be a helper
  file that is loaded first for creating mocks and doing other shortcuts
  (fastHelper.js) **Tests should be in a file named <something>-spec.js**
  * test/slow: Slow jasmine tests go here.  There should also be a helper
  file that is loaded first for creating mocks and doing other shortcuts
  (slowHelper.js) **Tests should be in a file named <something>-spec.js**
  * templates: This is where templates that are used to create the production
  and debug html files live.  The advantage of using these templates is that
  you can configure the behavior of the html around the JS.
  * config.json: This file contains the configuration settings necessary to
  create the debug and production html files.  
  * package.json: This file lists the dependencies for grunt
  * auth.json: This file should NOT be checked in.  Create this to create a
  debug version of the app, to run the slow test specs and/or to use grunt to
  install the app in your test environment.  (you can use the makeauth task to create this file, or make it by hand.) It should look like:
    {
        "username":"you@company.com",
        "password":"secret",
        "server": "https://rally1.rallydev.com"
    }

### Usage of the grunt file
####Tasks

##### grunt makeauth

This task will create an auth.json file in the proper format for you.  **Be careful** this will delete any existing auth.json file.  See **grunt deploy** to see the contents and use of this file.

##### grunt debug

Use grunt debug to create the debug html file.  You only need to run this when you have added new files to
the src directories.

##### grunt build

Use grunt build to create the production html file.  We still have to copy the html file to a panel to test.

##### grunt test-fast

Use grunt test-fast to run the Jasmine tests in the fast directory.  Typically, the tests in the fast
directory are more pure unit tests and do not need to connect to Rally.

##### grunt test-slow

Use grunt test-slow to run the Jasmine tests in the slow directory.  Typically, the tests in the slow
directory are more like integration tests in that they require connecting to Rally and interacting with
data.

##### grunt deploy

Use grunt deploy to build the deploy file and then install it into a new page/app in Rally.  It will create the page on the Home tab and then add a custom html app to the page.  The page will be named using the "name" key in the config.json file (with an asterisk prepended).

To use this task, you must create an auth.json file that contains the following keys:
{
    "username": "fred@fred.com",
    "password": "fredfredfred",
    "server": "https://us1.rallydev.com"
}

(Use your username and password, of course.)  NOTE: not sure why yet, but this task does not work against the demo environments.  Also, .gitignore is configured so that this file does not get committed.  Do not commit this file with a password in it!

When the first install is complete, the script will add the ObjectIDs of the page and panel to the auth.json file, so that it looks like this:

{
    "username": "fred@fred.com",
    "password": "fredfredfred",
    "server": "https://us1.rallydev.com",
    "pageOid": "52339218186",
    "panelOid": 52339218188
}

On subsequent installs, the script will write to this same page/app. Remove the
pageOid and panelOid lines to install in a new place.  CAUTION:  Currently, error checking is not enabled, so it will fail silently.

##### grunt watch

Run this to watch files (js and css).  When a file is saved, the task will automatically build and deploy as shown in the deploy section above.
